This "Cambridge Effect" is sort of true, but it does not tell the whole story.  It is relatively easy to read short words, but not so easy when reading longer words.  Alas, most content words in English are seven letters long or longer -- the more letters there are in a word, the more difficult and complicated it becomes to correctly identify them when the letters are rearranged.  Whereas, more diminutive and common words like "ball" and "bear" remain mostly unchanged and easy to recognize, longer, less common words, like "pollution" and "simultaneous" change substantially to the point where recognition is scarcely possible.  Furthermore, this ability stems from a great deal of experience reading correctly spelled words -- only people who can already read proficiently can do this task.  This trick does not reveal much about the process of learning to read -- it only indicates that highly skilled readers are so practiced with text they can overcome minor imperfections (emphasis on the word "minor") in the print to access meaning.
