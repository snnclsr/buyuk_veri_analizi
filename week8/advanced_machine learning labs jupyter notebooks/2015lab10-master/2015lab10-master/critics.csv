Vincent Canby,rotten,0074695,New York Times,"Mr. Peckinpah's least interesting, least personal film in years, a hysterically elaborate, made-in-Yugoslavia war spectacle, the work of international financiers and a multinational cast.",2005-05-09,13694,Cross of Iron

Bosley Crowther,fresh,0042276,New York Times,"More firm in its social implications than ever it was on the stage and blessed with a priceless performance by rocketing Judy Holliday, this beautifully integrated compound of character study and farce made a resounding entry at the Victoria yesterday.",2003-05-20,18781,Born Yesterday
Variety Staff,rotten,0086969,Variety,"Belying the lightheartedness of its title, Birdy is a heavy adult drama about best friends and the after-effects of war, but it takes too long to live up to its ambitious premise.",2008-09-16,15889,Birdy

Vincent Canby,fresh,0086005,New York Times,"Perhaps the best thing about the film is that the wolves are never made to seem like strange but cuddly dogs. They look like wolves, not especially threatening but still remote and complete unto themselves.",2004-08-30,12606,Never Cry Wolf
Dave Kehr,fresh,0086005,Chicago Reader,"The film is still memorable for its compassion, commitment, and unexpected humor, qualities that go a long way toward tempering the ecological didacticism of the screenplay.",2000-01-01,12606,Never Cry Wolf
