So when the p-value is small (we usually consider \"small\" as less than 0.05), what we're saying is that based on the data we observed, we know **fairly certainly** that temperature is strongly associated with the failure of O-rings. This is a very powerful statement that can take us a long way in terms of learning if used properly. Have a look at the Wikipedia page on [p-values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value) for a quick reminder.\n",

But generally, the idea is that the data may (or may not) have information about things you're interested in. We ask the data questions through hypotheses, but the more questions we ask of it, the higher chances we have of the data actually showing associations at random. Have alook at [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem) to get an idea of the problem and some solutions. We'll be considering a very crude solution known as the [Bonferroni correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction) but that is by no means the best solution. "
